# Problem
On this days, the countdown start between two vehicles is made by gestures or whistles, it's intended to find a simple and effective solution for both.


# Solution
The solution goes through a Bluetooth connection (client/server connection) with two android mobile devices (tablets/phones), where the **client** connects to the **server** and starts the count that will be done syncronized on both.
